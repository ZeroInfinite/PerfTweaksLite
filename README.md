# PerfTweaksLite (we've moved to CodePlex at https://perftweakslite.codeplex.com/)
Initial check-in

A simple project to support conditional get support for WebForms running on .NET 3.5 and above for C# and VB.NET. The main idea and code came from the article http://www.optimizeasp.net/conditional-get.

Please have a read at http://www.optimizeasp.net/conditional-get to get a better understanding and appreciation thanks to Mads Kristensen.

If you want to use it for projects that run on the .NET Framework version prior to .NET 3.5 then remove the extension syntax in C# denoted by this in the argument of the method and delete the module.vb file for VB.NET.
